# MOVIE-REVIEW
# ðŸ“– Project Description
This project builds a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative. I used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to prepare the text data and trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) model for classification.
The model was then deployed on a web application built with Flask and styled using HTML.
# Data Source
Dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simranjitkhehra/movie-rating-review-dataset)

Description: The dataset contains labeled movie reviews indicating whether a review is positive (1) or negative (0).
# Key objectves
1. How can we develop a sentiment analysis classification model to accurately predict the sentiment of text data?

2. How accurate is the MultinomialNB model for text classification tasks?

3. Can the trained model be integrated into a web application for real-time predictions?

# Methods and Tools Used
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text cleaning, tokenization, removing stopwords, TF-IDF vectorization

Machine Learning Model: Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

- scikit-learn

- pandas

- numpy

- Flask

Web Development:

- Flask (for backend routing and model deployment)

- HTML (for the front-end user interface)

# Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the text data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Applied TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.

Model Training: Trained a MultinomialNB classifier on the processed data.

Evaluation: Evaluated the model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Built a Flask application with an HTML front-end where users can input their movie reviews and receive real-time predictions.
